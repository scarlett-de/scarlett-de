# 👋 Hi, I'm Yitian(Scarlett) — Data Engineer

I'm a Data Engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and production-grade data pipelines. I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights using cloud platforms, open-source tools, and automation.

- I design and build end-to-end pipelines (batch & streaming)
-  Develop analytics-ready models with dbt
-  Deploy infrastructure with Terraform on GCP
-  Work with databases like PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and Parquet
-  Prepare data for dashboards using SQL, Python, and dbt
